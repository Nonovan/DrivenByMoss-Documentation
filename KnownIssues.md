# Known Issues

## Bitwig Studio
* The display update of the Akai Fire is very slow on Macos and makes it nearly unusable
* The display update of the Novation SL MkIII lags on Macos (might be the same issue as with Akai Fire but device is still usable)
* User Parameters cannot be reset
* Issue with Native Instruments A-series and M32, which causes that the extension is added multiple times on startup

## Cockos Reaper
* Browser support (devices and presets) is only available on devices with a display. Since the browser of Reaper cannot be controlled you are currently navigating blind.
